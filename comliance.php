                <h2>Compliance Services</h2>

                <p class="text_justify">Raising money for a flourishing business is challenging, and challenge of meeting all regulatory compliance requirements can be an overwhelming, both in time and money. Many corporations and municipalities rely on legal firms and/or escrow agencies to provide the verification of potential investors, as required by the regulations established by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).
                 </p>
          
                <p class="text_justify">When handled by legal firms, this process can be very costly, often has a slow turnaround time, and can hold up onboarding of investors and capital access. Compliance and Settlement Services (C&SS) offers a unique, cost-effective way to comply with verification requirements on behalf of a client company's securities offering.
