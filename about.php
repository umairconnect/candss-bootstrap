                <h2>About C&SS</h2>

                <p class="text_justify">Compliance and Settlement Services (C&SS) was founded in March 2021, to support an unserved market opportunity created by recent regulatory changes made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Company's insight and understanding of the requirements needed to be fulfilled by companies raising capital under SEC Regulation D exemptions allowed C&SS to envision a solution. A service offering was designed and developed that provides a mechanism for companies to outsource the receipt and verification of accredited investor funds and related documents. Comprehension of how to facilitate onboarding of investors in accordance and compliance with the SEC recommendations and regulations has created an all-encompassing platform.
