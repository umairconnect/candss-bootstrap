                    The various exemptions of registration allowed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) under Regulation D §230.504, §230.506b, and §230.506c specify that the Offeror of securities under these exemptions adhere to certain recommendations and requirements as laid out by the Commission.  Failure to adhere to these recommendations and requirements expose an Offeror of securities relying on these exemptions to various regulatory actions which could adversely impact funds raised under the benefit of the exemptions.  Compliance and Settlement Services has specifically designed a system and methodology that, when implemented on its clients behalf, meets or exceeds the recommendations and requirements of the Commission.  Remove the doubt of compliance from the already complicated task of raising capital for your company – let C&SS effectively and efficiently handle the onboarding of your investors in compliance with the regulations and recommendations established by the SEC.
